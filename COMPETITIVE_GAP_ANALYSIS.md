## 3. Where Stellar already wins
- Write + run graded code (Judge0) — competitors are read/watch.
- 8 interactive exercise types.
- Build-real-systems curriculum (Spring → Kafka → K8s → Spring AI) — unique.
- Socratic AI tutor.
- 245 concept visual aids.
- Certs + prereq DAG + spaced repetition + planner + analytics.
- Second market (K-12 CBSE/ICSE).
- **System Design topic COUNT (179) exceeds AlgoMaster's 177** — every topic has graded exercises + flow diagrams, plus a modern **AI/ML-infra** module AlgoMaster lacks. ⚠️ **COUNT ≠ DEPTH:** AlgoMaster's case-study articles are ~4,500–5,000 words with capacity math, API, schema, and real architecture diagrams; our topics were ~500 words + an MCQ with no authored diagrams. This was count-metric drift (caught 2026-06-05). **Fix in flight:** `SD_DEPTH_STANDARD.md` + `auditSysdDepth.mjs` now gate on depth; 29 flagship case studies are now at full depth (≥1.2k words, full framework, real SVGs, render-verified): URL shortener, rate limiter, news feed, chat, KV store, Instagram, video streaming, ride-sharing, web crawler, distributed cache, typeahead, search engine, message queue, leaderboard, notifications, payment system, maps routing, file sync, unique-id generator, object store (S3), proximity service, distributed lock, job scheduler, distributed counter, top-k/trending, CDN, log aggregation, metrics/monitoring, saga orchestrator — plus API gateway, SSO, CDC, service mesh, tracing, webhooks, service discovery, schema registry, audit log, multi-tenant SaaS, GDPR deletion, OTP/2FA, vector DB, RAG, LLM serving, MLOps registry, load balancer, DNS, DDoS, WAF, CA/PKI, KMS, pub/sub, secrets manager, data warehouse, lakehouse, ETL orchestration, real-time OLAP, anomaly detection, stream processing, container orchestrator, backup/DR, collaborative whiteboard, geospatial DB, blockchain/ledger, image-processing CDN, stock brokerage, photo storage, music streaming, distributed file system, video conferencing, live streaming, IoT platform, multiplayer game server, hot ranking (Reddit/HN), RTB ad exchange, content moderation, ad-click aggregator, Twitter (timeline fanout), Google Docs (collaborative editing), stock exchange (matching engine), flash sale, online code judge, Airbnb/Booking, recommendation system, email service (Gmail), ticket booking (Ticketmaster), pastebin, live presence, Slack, time-series DB, multi-region DB, distributed SQL (NewSQL), serverless/FaaS, workflow engine, media processing pipeline, A/B testing platform, fraud detection, Tinder (matching), comment system, live location sharing, CI/CD pipeline, feature-flag/config service, push notification gateway, social graph (PYMK), shopping cart & checkout, subscription billing, matchmaking, feature store (ML), calendar/scheduling, distributed web cache/reverse proxy, offline-first sync, Q&A platform, distributed graph DB, uptime/status monitoring, two-sided marketplace, package registry, captcha/bot detection, stock market data feed, last-mile delivery routing, developer API platform, e-signature, zero-trust access, webhook ingestion gateway, quota/usage-metering, distributed model training, PII anonymization pipeline, geo load balancing (GSLB), plagiarism detection, credit scoring, KYC/identity verification, bulk email/campaign sender, price-comparison aggregator, online learning platform, loyalty/rewards, sportsbook/live-betting, restaurant reservation, helpdesk/ticketing — **DEEP coverage 137/143 case studies (~96%)** (incl. AI/ML-infra, security/networking-infra, data-infra, platform-infra, and media/real-time sets AlgoMaster lacks); the remaining 6 are shallow until deepened. Do NOT claim depth parity from the topic count. (2026-06-06)
- **Low-Level Design depth (172 topics) at parity with AlgoMaster's 173** — 110 OOD case studies + all 23 GoF patterns + 16 data structures + 8 concurrency primitives, each with graded exercises (and 10 code-verified on Judge0). Two former *gaps* (#2, #4) are now *wins*. (2026-06-05)

## 3a. Net competitive verdict (2026-06-05)
Stellar now **matches or exceeds AlgoMaster on its own home turf** (DSA breadth, coding patterns, System Design, LLD, Concurrency, Behavioral, Notes, Listen) while keeping its structural advantages competitors can't easily copy: **graded code execution, interactive exercise types, a Socratic AI tutor, a build-real-systems backend curriculum, and a second K-12 market.** vs **DSA Animator**, Stellar leads on everything except raw step-by-step animation coverage (their USP — our GAP #1, in progress) and a jobs board. Remaining true gaps are small/peripheral: **resume tool / jobs board** (#9, not started) and finishing **DSA animation coverage** (GAP #1). The depth battle with AlgoMaster is effectively won; the differentiation battle was already ours.

## 5. GAP #1 — Animation coverage (DETAILED)

**Goal:** every animatable DSA code problem has a step-by-step animation (not capped at 100).

**Scope:** 763 code problems. ~48 `complexity-analysis` are Big-O reasoning (not step-animatable) → out of scope. Target ≈ **700**.

**Approach:** per-pattern **stage generators** in the seed (one generator animates every problem of that pattern from its example input) + new `StepPlayer` renderers as needed. Renderers existing: `array-pointers`, `stack`, `grid`, `monotonic`.

**Renderers to build:** table (hashing), linked-list, heap-tree, dp-table, queue, tree, sort, backtrack-tree, bits, bsearch, string, unionfind.

**✅ COMPLETE: 598 / 598 animatable (100%) — ALL 30 patterns FULL, 0 broken (local + prod, 2026-06-04).**
Every animatable Pro-Java DSA problem now has a step-by-step animation. Out of scope (by design): 48 complexity-analysis (Big-O reasoning) + 117 M42/M45 mock/interview (timed practice). Verify any time: `node config/auditAnimations.mjs` (local) or via the api container on prod.

**(historical) Animated through batch 18: 331 / 598 (55%).** 14 patterns FULL at that point.
- Original 21 pilots: two-pointers ×6, sliding-window ×4, monotonic-stack ×3, grid ×3, batch2 ×5.
- `seedAnimationCoverage1.js` (2026-06-04): +6 sliding-window (Max-Sum-K, Find Anagrams, ≤2 Distinct, Char Replacement, Fruit Baskets, Longest-1s-after-deletion).

## 6. CROSS-VERIFICATION (prod DB audit, 2026-06-04)

Ground truth pulled from `proexercises` on prod (not estimates):
- DSA code problems: **763** · animatable (excl. 48 complexity-analysis): **715** · **animated & live: 119** · remaining: **596** · **~17% done**.
- Integrity: every animation uses a registered renderer (array-pointers 49, tree 26, grid 21, stack 15, linked-list 8); **0 missing-steps, 0 unrenderable kind**. All 5 renderers verified rendering (dev + prod screenshots during batches 1–7).

**Authoritative done / total per pattern (replaces the §5 estimates):**

| pattern | done/total | | pattern | done/total |
|---|--:|---|---|--:|
| two-pointers | 11/25 | | bst | 5/12 |

| backtracking | 3/16 | | strings | 2/13 |
| binary-search | 5/13 | | complexity-analysis | ⏭️ 48 (out of scope) |

**Zero-coverage to prioritize next:** tree-traversal (15), stack-queue (11), binary-search-on-answer (7), and triage the **117 untagged** problems.
