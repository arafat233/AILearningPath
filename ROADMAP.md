## Status legend

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` done — note the commit SHA + date inline
- `[-]` deferred / dropped (record why)

---

## Where we are (v2.1 baseline)

- 46 modules / 232 topics / 3,311 exercises / 232 projects / 168,365 XP
- Backend models: ProTrack / ProModule / ProTopic / ProExercise / ProProject / ProSubmission / ProProgress
- Test-case shapes verified end-to-end: `expected_stdout` (exact + whitespace-tolerant) · `expected_stdout_contains` · `text_match` · `code_analysis` · `must_compile` aliases · `stdin` per case · `expected_output_pattern`
- Frontend: tiered ProCourseLanding · ProModuleView with difficulty pips + completion · ProTopicView · ProExerciseRunner (Judge0-backed)
- Acceptance test: `scripts/acceptanceTestV2.mjs` — 4/4 PASS against live stack

**Known gaps not addressed in this roadmap (filed for later):** modern Java features in M4-M8 content; ArrayList gated by 17 OOP topics before M6; M4-T1 difficulty cliff (10 concepts in one topic). These are content rewrites, not features.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation Polish (target: 1 week)

Goal: ship the visualizer + tutor + pattern-recognition trinity that defines Stellar's pedagogical moat against ChatGPT + LeetCode.

**Phase exit criteria:**
- A learner on M39 Binary Search can see the algorithm animate
- A learner stuck on an exercise can ask the in-app tutor for a hint and receive a Socratic question (not the answer)
- A new "Pattern Drill" mode exists on at least 3 modules with 5+ questions each

---

### A. Visualizer Port (1–2 days)

Source projects: `~/Downloads/dsalearn/` + `~/Downloads/dsa-visualizer 2/`. See architecture note in [PROJECT decisions / 2026-05-26 visualizer architecture].

- [x] **A1.** Create `ai-learning-frontend/frontend/src/components/dsa/` directory — done 2026-05-26. Also added `framer-motion ^12.40.0` to frontend deps (was missing; both source projects depend on it).
- [x] **A2.** Port `ArrayBars` component from `dsa-visualizer 2/src/components/ArrayBars.tsx` — done 2026-05-26. Also ported `types/animation.ts` → `types.js` (JSDoc, unified with dsalearn's StepType: 15 step kinds) and `utils/generateArray.ts` → `utils/generateArray.js`.
- [x] **A3.** Port `LinkedListVisualizer.tsx` from `dsalearn/components/visualizers/` — done 2026-05-26. JSX with framer-motion `AnimatePresence` for node insertion/deletion.
- [x] **A4.** Port `StackVisualizer.tsx` from `dsalearn/components/visualizers/` — done 2026-05-26. Push slides in from top, pop exits to the right.
- [x] **A5.** Port `TreeVisualizer.tsx` from `dsalearn/components/visualizers/` — done 2026-05-26. SVG-based, recursive position layout with x-coord normalisation so deep trees stay in viewport.
- [ ] **A6.** Port step-generators: `binarySearch.ts`, `linearSearch.ts`, `linkedList.ts` from `dsalearn/lib/algorithms/`. Plus all 5 sorts (`bubble`, `insertion`, `selection`, `merge`, `quick`) from `dsa-visualizer 2/src/algorithms/`. These are pure functions — copy verbatim.
- [ ] **A7.** Port `studentRunner.ts` from `dsa-visualizer 2/src/utils/` AS-IS (the JS code tracer that runs student-written sort code with `compare()`/`swap()` instrumentation).
- [ ] **A8.** Build reusable `VisualizerShell.jsx` — playback controls (play / pause / step / stop), speed slider, step indicator. One shell, all visualizers plug in.
- [ ] **A9.** Add `visualizer` field to `ProTopic` schema: `{ kind: "binary-search" | "sorting-sandbox" | "linked-list" | "stack" | "tree", config?: {...} }`. Backward-compatible (optional).
- [ ] **A10.** Update `ProTopicView.jsx` to render the matching visualizer component under the teaching block when `topic.visualizer` is set.
- [ ] **A11.** Wire M38-T1 (Sorting) as the proof topic — sets `visualizer: { kind: "sorting-sandbox" }` with all 5 sort algorithms + student mode enabled.
- [ ] **A12.** **Acceptance:** visit `/pro/java/java_m38/java_m38_t1`, see the sort visualizer, click play, see bars animate. Toggle student mode, paste a custom sort, see it run.

**Wire-up topics (after A12 passes):**
- [ ] **A13.** M30-T1 (two pointers) → `array-pointers` visualizer
- [ ] **A14.** M32-T1, T3 (linked lists, reversal) → `linked-list`
- [ ] **A15.** M33-T1 (stacks) → `stack`
- [ ] **A16.** M35-T1 (tree traversal) → `tree`
- [ ] **A17.** M39-T1 (binary search) → `binary-search`

---

### B. AI Socratic Tutor (3–5 days)

The single highest-ROI feature. Justifies a paid tier on its own.

- [ ] **B1.** Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to backend env config (`.env`, `.env.example`, deployment notes)
- [ ] **B2.** Create `ProTutorSession` Mongoose model: `{ userId, exerciseId, messages: [{ role, content, ts }], createdAt }` with 30-day TTL (same pattern as `ProSubmission`)
- [ ] **B3.** New `services/tutorService.js` with Claude API integration. System prompt baked here. Sonnet for the first iteration (better at Socratic teaching than Haiku); revisit cost after first 100 sessions.
- [ ] **B4.** System prompt + few-shot examples in `services/tutorPrompts.js`. Rules: never give the answer, ask one question at a time, reference the student's actual code, escalate hint specificity if they ask 3+ times.
- [ ] **B5.** Route `POST /api/v1/pro/tutor/ask` — body `{ exerciseId, studentCode, question }`. Auth + email allowlist + rate limit (10 questions/hour per user via Redis).
- [ ] **B6.** Build `TutorPanel.jsx` — collapsible chat sidebar in `ProExerciseRunner`. Shows conversation history for the current exercise.
- [ ] **B7.** Add 👍/👎 feedback buttons after each tutor message → write to `ProTutorSession.messages[i].rating`. Use to tune prompts.
- [ ] **B8.** Telemetry: `pro.tutor.message_sent` event with `{ exerciseId, messageLength, durationMs, model }` for later analysis.
- [ ] **B9.** Cost guardrail: refuse to send if `studentCode.length > 8000` (Claude context cost) — show "your code is too long for the tutor; please share a specific snippet".
- [ ] **B10.** **Acceptance:** open `java_m1_t6_ex_4` Scanner exercise, leave the code half-written, click "Ask tutor". Tutor responds with a question like "What does `sc.nextInt()` return when the buffer is empty?" — NOT "you need to call sc.close()". Send second message, get follow-up. Submit thumbs-up.

---

### C. Pattern Recognition Module (2–3 days)

Trains the "I smell sliding-window" instinct that wins FAANG screens.

- [ ] **C1.** Extend `ProExercise.type` enum: add `pattern_match` (currently has `code_scratch`, `fill_blank`, `predict_output`, `debug`, `refactor`, `algorithm`, `tests_pass`, `written_response`, `conceptual`).
- [ ] **C2.** Define `pattern_match` test_case shape: `{ type: "pattern_match", options: ["two_pointer", "sliding_window", ...], correct: "sliding_window", explanation: "..." }`. The "exercise" itself contains just the problem statement + options. No code execution.
- [ ] **C3.** Update `runTestCases` in `codeExecutionService.js` to handle `pattern_match` (just string compare, no sandbox call).
- [ ] **C4.** New frontend variant `PatternMatchRunner.jsx` — shows problem statement, radio buttons for pattern options, submit button. After submit: reveal correct answer + explanation, mark right/wrong.
- [ ] **C5.** Dispatcher: `ProExerciseRunner.jsx` reads `exercise.type` and routes to `CodeRunner` (existing) or `PatternMatchRunner` (new) or `PredictOutputRunner` (existing).
- [ ] **C6.** Author 20 starter pattern-match problems split across M30 (arrays — 5), M33 (stacks/queues — 5), M37 (graphs — 5), M41 (DP — 5). Use existing topic content for the problem statements (just hide the algorithm name).
- [ ] **C7.** Pattern catalog (the canonical option list): `two_pointer`, `sliding_window`, `prefix_sum`, `binary_search`, `hash_map`, `monotonic_stack`, `dfs`, `bfs`, `topological_sort`, `dynamic_programming`, `greedy`, `backtracking`, `divide_and_conquer`, `union_find`.
- [ ] **C8.** "Pattern Drill" mode: a topic-level "Practice patterns" button that loops through that topic's pattern_match exercises in a quick-fire sequence (no individual page transitions).
- [ ] **C9.** **Acceptance:** visit M30's "Pattern Drills" → answer 5 multiple-choice problems → see score (e.g. 4/5) + explanations on the misses.

---

### Phase 1 wrap-up

- [ ] **P1-wrap.** Commit + push the Phase 1 work in logical chunks (visualizer in one commit, tutor in another, pattern in a third)
- [ ] **P1-tag.** Tag `pilot-pro-java-v3.0-phase1` at HEAD
- [ ] **P1-docs.** Update `BLUEPRINT.md` track table with the three new capabilities
- [ ] **P1-test.** Extend `acceptanceTestV3.mjs` (new file) — verify pattern_match endpoint + tutor route work end-to-end

---

## Phase 2 — Differentiator Features (target: 2–3 weeks)

Goal: features that turn Stellar from "good learning platform" into "the obvious choice for Java interview prep in India."

**Phase exit criteria:**
- A learner can complete a 45-minute mock interview and receive a structured rubric
- Topics surface relevant job market data
- Completed topics resurface for review on a schedule

---

### D. Complexity Derivation System (2–3 days)

Reuses the step-trace plumbing from Phase 1.A.

- [ ] **D1.** Op-counter wrapper for step generators. Each call to `compare()` / `swap()` / `traverse()` increments a counter passed in the closure.
- [ ] **D2.** `ComplexityPlot.jsx` — line chart (using existing chart lib if any, otherwise SVG) plotting ops-executed vs `n` for the currently selected algorithm. Updates live as the user changes `n` via slider.
- [ ] **D3.** Complexity curve overlays: linear `n`, log `log n`, `n log n`, quadratic `n²`, etc. — drawn faintly behind the actual curve so the user can see which one matches.
- [ ] **D4.** "Guess the curve" widget — picks one of 5 curves, asks the user which class the actual data matches before revealing.
- [ ] **D5.** Embed under M29-T1 (Big-O notation) AND on every algorithm topic that has a visualizer.
- [ ] **D6.** **Acceptance:** visit M38 sorting, see the ops plot. Switch from bubble (n²) to merge sort (n log n), see the curve flatten dramatically. Slide n from 10 → 100, watch the bubble curve grow 100× while merge grows ~150×.

---

### E. Job Market Intelligence MVP (3–5 days)

Motivation layer — biggest retention lever per industry data.

- [ ] **E1.** One-time scrape: ~500 Java job postings from Naukri / Cutshort / LinkedIn (NOT scraping LinkedIn — TOS issue; use their public Jobs API if affordable, or paste exports manually for MVP).
- [ ] **E2.** Tag each posting with skills present. Format: `{ company, role, city, ctc_range, posted_at, skills: ["spring-boot", "kafka", ...], jd_excerpt }`. Store as `data/jobs/jobs.json` in repo (no scraper infra yet — manual is fine for MVP).
- [ ] **E3.** Skill catalog mapping: pro-track module slugs → job-skill tags. E.g. `m13_spring_boot` ↔ `spring-boot`, `spring`, `spring-mvc`.
- [ ] **E4.** Backend service `jobMarketService.js`: `getSkillStats(skill) → { count, sampleListings, avgCtcRange, topCompanies, citiesInDemand }`.
- [ ] **E5.** Backend route `GET /api/v1/jobs/skill/:skill` and `GET /api/v1/jobs/skills/summary` (track-level).
- [ ] **E6.** Frontend widget `SkillJobsCard.jsx` — shows on ProModuleView ("247 jobs need this skill in Hyderabad · ₹6-18L range · top hirers: Razorpay, Flipkart").
- [ ] **E7.** Dashboard widget `JobMarketSnapshot.jsx` — "Complete M14 to unlock 247 jobs" calls-to-action driven by user's progress vs the data.
- [ ] **E8.** **Acceptance:** visit M13 Spring Boot module, see job count + sample listings + CTC range. Click into one, see the JD excerpt.

**Phase E v2 (deferred):** automate the scrape + a weekly cron. Not required for MVP.

---

### F. Spaced Repetition (3 days)

Filed as an addition to the original 10. Per retention research, this is the single biggest learning ROI lever after the tutor.

- [ ] **F1.** Add `lastReviewedAt`, `reviewIntervalDays` to each entry in `ProProgress.completedTopics` (currently a flat string array → migrate to `[{ topicId, completedAt, lastReviewedAt, intervalDays }]`).
- [ ] **F2.** Implement SM-2 lite: intervals `1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → 30d → 90d`. On review:  if rated "got it" → next interval; if "rusty" → reset to 1d.
- [ ] **F3.** Backend route `GET /api/v1/pro/review/due` — returns topics whose `lastReviewedAt + intervalDays <= now`.
- [ ] **F4.** Frontend page `/pro/review` — list of due topics with a quick-review button each.
- [ ] **F5.** Quick-review mode: 3 multiple-choice questions per topic, 5-minute cap. Pulls questions from existing `predict_output` / `pattern_match` exercises for that topic.
- [ ] **F6.** Dashboard widget: "3 topics due for review today" prompt.
- [ ] **F7.** **Acceptance:** complete a topic, advance system clock 1 day (or wait), see topic appear in review queue. Review it. Repeat over multiple intervals.

---

### G. Problem-First Reveal Toggle (1 day — quick win)

- [ ] **G1.** Add `revealStrategy: "always" | "first_attempt"` field to `ProTopic` (default `"always"` preserves current behavior).
- [ ] **G2.** Update `ProTopicView.jsx` to hide the algorithm name and "key takeaways" behind a "Reveal" button when `revealStrategy === "first_attempt"`. Track reveal click via telemetry event.
- [ ] **G3.** Audit ~10 topics where the algorithm name in the title is the answer (e.g. M39-T1 "Binary Search basics" — flip to "Searching in sorted data" with `revealStrategy: "first_attempt"`).
- [ ] **G4.** **Acceptance:** visit M39-T1, see only the problem (search 5 million items quickly). Try to solve. Click reveal → see "this is binary search" + the full topic content.

---

### H. Interview Simulator (1–2 weeks)

The premium-tier feature. Reuses Phase 1.B tutor infrastructure.

- [ ] **H1.** New route `/pro/interview` + page `InterviewSimulator.jsx`
- [ ] **H2.** Session model `ProInterviewSession`: `{ userId, problemId, startedAt, endedAt, transcript, code, rubricScore, feedback }`
- [ ] **H3.** Pre-session: pick problem from a curated 100-problem bank (cross-cutting from M30-M41 + select interview prep modules)
- [ ] **H4.** UI: 45-minute countdown timer (top bar), code editor (Monaco), scratchpad (markdown for explanations + bullet points), AI interviewer chat (right panel)
- [ ] **H5.** Mock interviewer (Claude API, different system prompt from B): starts with the problem, accepts clarifying questions, probes after silence > 60s ("what are you thinking?"), asks complexity questions, throws curveballs ("what if input is 10 GB?")
- [ ] **H6.** Mid-session timeout warnings: 30/15/5 min remaining
- [ ] **H7.** Post-session rubric — 5 dimensions scored 1-5: clarifying questions asked, communication of approach, code quality, complexity awareness, curveball handling. Generated by Claude reading the transcript.
- [ ] **H8.** Session history page `/pro/interview/history` — past sessions with scores + transcripts
- [ ] **H9.** **Acceptance:** complete a full 45-min mock, receive a written rubric with scores and 3 specific improvement areas. Replay the transcript.

---

### Phase 2 wrap-up

- [ ] **P2-wrap.** Commits + push
- [ ] **P2-tag.** Tag `pilot-pro-java-v3.0-phase2`
- [ ] **P2-docs.** Update `BLUEPRINT.md` + `CONTENT_STATUS.md`

---

## Phase 3 — Rolling Improvements

No deadline. Ship one per week as bandwidth allows.

### I. Deep Visualizations

Each = ~1 day of work. Ranked by impact.

- [ ] **I1.** Recursion tree visualizer — used by M40 Backtracking, M41 DP. Shows the call tree with memoization hits highlighted.
- [ ] **I2.** Graph BFS/DFS animation — used by M37. Animated traversal with frontier + visited highlighting.
- [ ] **I3.** Heap sift-up/sift-down — used by M36. Bubble visualization of heap rebalancing.
- [ ] **I4.** Hash collision walk — used by M34. Shows separate-chaining or open-addressing in motion.
- [ ] **I5.** Trie character path — used by M35-T5. Highlights the path through the trie for a search/insert.

### J. Missing Content Lessons (beta-driven)

Don't bulk-add. Let beta feedback drive what's most missing.

- [ ] **J1.** New module M47 "Modern Java Features" (records, var, text blocks, sealed classes, pattern matching) — content authoring
- [ ] **J2.** New module M48 "Engineering Hygiene" (Maven/Gradle deep dive, Git collab, IntelliJ tooling)
- [ ] **J3.** New module M49 "Technical Communication" (PR descriptions, code review, design docs)

Mark these `[ ]` only when a beta user has explicitly asked for them. Otherwise they stay listed as candidates.

---

## Deferred (revisit on signal)

- [-] **K. "Build From Scratch" Deep Track** — niche audience; not justified vs Phase 1-2 ROI. Revisit if 5+ users request it.
- [-] **L. Other Languages (Python / JS / Go)** — schema supports it but no content. Revisit after the Java track has 100+ paying users.

---

## Decision log

### 2026-05-26 · Visualizer architecture
- Decided: port both `dsalearn` + `dsa-visualizer 2` as components into the existing Vite frontend; do NOT keep them as separate Next.js apps. Cleanest integration with auth/layout/progress; avoids iframe and TOS-of-Next.js-16 issues.
- Decided: do NOT try to drive visualizers from Judge0 output. Judge0 returns stdout; visualizers need typed step events. Two parallel teaching modalities on the same page (visualizer = intuition, Judge0 = correctness).
- Source: this session's exploration of both folders.

### 2026-05-26 · Phase ordering
- Phase 1 trio (Visualizer + Tutor + Pattern Recognition) chosen because they're independent of each other (low risk of one blocking another) AND together they form the moat: visualization is what LeetCode lacks, tutor is what ChatGPT can't do without curriculum context, pattern drills are what FAANG candidates pay for.
- AI Socratic Tutor (B) chosen as the single highest-ROI feature on the list. Cost: <$1/user/month with rate limits. Value: the only feature ChatGPT can't easily replicate.

### 2026-05-26 · Out of scope for this roadmap
- Production deployment (Oracle Cloud per `project_deployment_process` memory) — separate workstream, blocks beta launch but not v3 feature work
- Mobile / PWA — no demand signal yet
- Multi-language UI (Hindi / Telugu) — defer until 1000+ users
- Group / cohort features — defer to Phase 4
